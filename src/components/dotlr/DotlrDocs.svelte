<h2>
    Grammar syntax
</h2>
<Column gap="0.5rem">
    <p>
        You can write the grammar for the language you want to recognize by writing Terminals, Non-terminals, and
        Regexes.
        <br/>
        Here is an example grammar that uses all of them:
    </p>
    <Card padding="1rem">

        <SyntaxHighlighter
                source={`P -> E

E -> E '+' T
E -> T

T -> %id '(' E ')'
T -> %id

%id -> /[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]+/`}
                language="dotlr"
        />
    </Card>
    Terminals are written by being surrounded by apostrophes, a regex token is defined by using a % sign before the name
    of the token, all the rest are non-terminals.
    This grammar is able to recognize the expression (as an example):
    <Card padding="1rem">
        foo(bar+baz)
    </Card>

    <h2>
        Episilon
    </h2>
    <p>
        You can write the epsilon symbol by writing a rule with only the empty string as it's body <code>S -> ''</code>
    </p>
        <Card padding="1rem">

        <SyntaxHighlighter
                source={`S -> 'h' B 'e'
B -> B A
B -> ''
A -> 'x'
A -> 't'`}
                language="dotlr"
        />
    </Card>
</Column>



<h2>
    Steps
</h2>
<p>
    With the app you can both look at the language's properties (like the FIRST, FOLLOW, automaton table etc...)
    and you can also parse a string to see if it is recognized by the grammar, this will produce a parse tree that you
    can visualize.
</p>
<p>
    Once you compile the language or parse a string, the individual steps needed to complete the operation will be
    shown below the editor and you can click on them to see the details.
